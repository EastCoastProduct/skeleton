This is a short introduction on how to use the ECP API Boilerplate. Things that are
documented:<br>
  - Most errors responses
  - Requests
  - Responses
  - Examples
  - Routes
  - Descriptions for each error, route, request and response

Some error handling of requests are generically validated and are not documented
here, because their responses are always the same. Most of them are mentioned in
the description and their logic is straightforward.

An example of a invalid request sent for authentication:
<pre>
{
  "email": "wrong.mail"
}
</pre>

An example error:

<pre>
{
  "message": "Parameters error",
  "debugInfo": [
    {
      "path": "email",
      "message": "has to be valid email"
    },
    {
      "path": "password",
      "message": "required"
    }
  ],
  "error": {
    "message": "Parameters error",
    "status": 400,
    "debugInfo": [
      {
        "path": "email",
        "message": "has to be valid email"
      },
      {
        "path": "password",
        "message": "required"
      }
    ]
  }
}
</pre>

Some formats are explicitly described, but some are straightforward and
not described:
  - <b>email</b> <i>(valid email address)</i>
  - <b>ip</b> <i>(valid ip address)</i>

<i>
*
  Only valid requests are made in the routes.
  Invalid requests will be handled by the example above.
